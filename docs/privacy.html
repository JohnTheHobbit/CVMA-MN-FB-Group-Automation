            <h3>What We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you use the &ldquo;Continue with Facebook&rdquo; feature on this site, we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Facebook user ID (a numeric identifier)</li>
                <li>Your Facebook display name</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you choose the manual entry option instead, we collect only the Facebook profile URL you provide.</p>

            <h3>Why We Collect It</h3>
            <p>This information is used solely to match your Facebook account to your CVMA Minnesota chapter membership record. This allows chapter officers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify and approve your request to join the CVMA-MN Facebook group</li>
                <li>Manage group membership as members join or leave the chapter</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Store It</h3>
            <p>Your Facebook profile information is stored in a private Airtable database accessible only to CVMA Minnesota chapter leadership. It is not shared with any third parties, used for advertising, or sold.</p>

            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>Your Facebook profile information is retained in our records as long as you are a member of CVMA Minnesota. If you leave the chapter, your record may be retained for administrative purposes but your Facebook data will no longer be actively used.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You may request to view, update, or delete your Facebook profile information from our records at any time by contacting your chapter Public Relations Officer.</p>

            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>For questions about this privacy policy or your data, contact the CVMA Minnesota chapter PRO through your normal chapter communication channels.</p>
